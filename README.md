## Description

I was given the assignment through Triliogy/WASHU Coding Bootcamp to create an employee directory with React.

The user story was that, "As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information". Also, "An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name".
